Description: Fit and compare nonlinear mixed-effects models in differential 
  equations with flexible dosing information commonly seen in pharmacokinetics 
  and pharmacodynamics <doi:10.1007/s10928-015-9409-1>. Differential 
  equation solving is by compiled C code provided in the 'RxODE' package 
  (Wang, Hallow, and James 2015 <doi:10.1002/psp4.12052>).
  The code are all released under GPL, since each piece is GPL-compatible.  
  The n1qn1 and all scilab rountines are released under the GPL-compatiable
